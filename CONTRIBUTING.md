## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code

```python
# Good: Clear function documentation
def analyze_flood_risk(dem_layer, water_level):
    """
    Analyze flood risk based on DEM and water level.
    
    Args:
        dem_layer (QgsRasterLayer): Digital elevation model
        water_level (float): Flood water level in meters
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if analysis successful, False otherwise
    """
    pass

# Good: Error handling
try:
    result = process_data()
except Exception as e:
    self.log_message(f"Error processing data: {e}")
    return False
```
